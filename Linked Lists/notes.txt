👉 Use Linked list real life uses
    ✴️Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science and can be used in many real-life applications where data needs to be managed and organized dynamically. Here are a few examples:
   
    1️⃣Music playlists: Music playlists can be represented as linked lists, where each song node is linked to the next song node. This allows for easy insertion and removal of songs in the playlist.

    2️⃣Browser history: Browsers use a linked list to store the browsing history. Each node in the linked list represents a webpage, and the links between nodes represent the sequence in which the pages were visited.

    3️⃣Train and airline reservation systems: In reservation systems, a linked list can be used to keep track of available seats. Each node in the list represents a seat, and the links between nodes represent the adjacency relationships between seats.

    4️⃣File systems: Linked lists are used in file systems to keep track of the files stored on a disk. Each node in the linked list represents a file, and the links between nodes represent the location of the file on the disk.

    5️⃣Polynomial manipulation: In mathematics, linked lists can be used to represent polynomials. Each node in the linked list represents a term in the polynomial, and the links between nodes represent the coefficients and exponents of the terms.

   ✴️These are just a few examples of the many real-life applications of linked lists. In general, linked lists are useful when the data needs to be stored and manipulated dynamically, and the size of the data may vary over time
